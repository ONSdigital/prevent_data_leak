# prevent_data_leak

This is a [pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) to prevent data leaks. 

Using .gitignore is an effective but not totally fool-proof method of preventing the committing of data and the prevention of data leaks. 

James and [Paige](https://github.com/paigeh1) thought a pre-commit helper could be a good idea to help prevent data leaks onto code repositories so we created this repository. Along with .gitignore, this is a "belt and braces" approach.
